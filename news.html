<p1>Many of our rivers, lakes, and groundwaters have unnaturally high levels of nutrients, chemicals, disease-causing pathogens, and sediment. Pollution degrades the health, mauri, and wairua of waterways and can make our water unsafe for drinking, recreation, food gathering, and cultural activities.

  Several different types of pollutants affect our freshwater. Nutrients (like nitrogen and phosphorus) can lead to algal blooms that degrade ecosystems and the cultural and recreational value of water. Sediment makes the water cloudy and smothers natural habitats on the bottom and banks of rivers and lakes. Pathogens like Campylobacter can make people ill when they drink or swim in polluted water. Emerging pollutants are non-natural chemicals that we know little about, including their effects on human health and the environment.
  
  Rivers, lakes, wetlands, and groundwater are parts of an interconnected freshwater system, and poor water quality in one part of the system can affect water quality elsewhere within a catchment.
  
  Pollution of our freshwater is not the result of any single land use, but comes from the mosaic of cities, farms, and plantation forests we see in most river catchments. Our activities in these areas support our lifestyles and economy but have required land to be cleared, drained, and modified. These changes and the way we manage our land have caused more pollutants to be discharged into freshwater.
  
  Applying pesticides and fertilisers, increasing the number of cattle per hectare, felling and replanting pine trees, and faulty wastewater and stormwater infrastructure are all examples of activities that contribute to water pollution.</p1>
